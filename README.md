## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will showcases projects that I've made to improve my analytics skills and use different technology in problem solving
### Analysing Covid19 data
**Code:** [`Covid19 Analysis.sql`](https://github.com/Quang0608/PortfolioProject/blob/main/src/sql/Covid19_Data_Exploration.sql)

**Description:** The dataset captures detailed records of Covid-19 cases, fatalities, and vaccination efforts across countries during 2020-2021. This project delves into crucial steps such as data loading, meticulous cleaning, preprocessing, and an insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.

**Skills:** Joins, Window Functions, Aggregations Functions

**Technology** PostgreSql

### RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation
**Code:** [`RFM_Segmentaion.sql`](https://github.com/Quang0608/PortfolioProject/blob/main/src/sql/RFM_Segmentation.sql)
**Report**[`Customer 360 report`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ex6pbtV7TY55nRX_lsN-MG3VKPTBkC_P/view?usp=sharing)

**Description:** This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of our customer base by creating a Customer 360 profile, analyzing transaction data, and applying Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) metrics to segment customers. The insights derived will empower the marketing team to design targeted campaigns and implement effective customer policies, ultimately enhancing customer engagement and driving sales growth.

**Skills:** RFM-Segmentation, Customer-Analytics, SQL-Window-Functions, PowerBI-Dashboard

**Technology** SQL Server, Power BI

### Predicting ROAS Based on Number of App Installations
**Code**[`Predict ROAS.`](https://github.com/Quang0608/PortfolioProject/blob/main/src/sql/Predict%20ROAS%20project.ipynb)

**Description:** This project analyzes the relationship between the number of app installations and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) on Day 0. The goal is to explore how installation volume affects ad revenue performance and build regression-based models to predict ROAS on following days.

**Skills** Predictive analysis, time-series analysis, machine learning, statistical analysis

**Technology/Library** Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, LinearRegression, Polynomial Regression
